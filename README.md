# Uber App Simulator
With this simplified ride-sharing app written in Java, the core functionality allows for user and driver registration, ride and delivery requests, sorting mechanisms, and error handling for invalid input scenarios.
This is achieved with the user of object-oriented programming principles including inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces. Moreover, Java ArrayLists and static methods are used for data management and address validation.
Compile and run the UberUI.java file and try out some of these commands:
- users
- drivers
- loadusers (requires .txt file with name, address and account funds on separate lines)
- loaddrivers (requires .txt file with name, car, license plate, address on separate lines)
- requests
- reqride
- reqdlvy
- pickup
- dropoff
- driveto
